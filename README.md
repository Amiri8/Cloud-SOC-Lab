# Project Overview 
This project documents my journey in building a Cloud SOC using Microsoft Azure and Sentinel. It showcases how I leverage KQL queries within Microsoft Sentinel and other Microsoft security tools to monitor, detect, and investigate threats.

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in modern cloud SOC operations from environment setup to incident investigation and response with a focus on phishing analysis, threat detection, and incident reporting.

# Tools used
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Microsoft Azure
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Microsoft 365 Security

# Lab Environment
- Cloud: Microsoft Azure 
- SOC: Microsoft Sentinel 
- Resource Group
- Endpoint: 1 Windows VM (windows11)
- Network: VNet (windows11-vnet/default)

## What I've built and investigated 
- Set up and configured a Microsoft Sentinel workspace integrated with Azure resources.
- Connected Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and XDR data sources for enhanced telemetry.
- Designed a custom SOC dashboard to visualise security logs and alerts (see Dashboards/screenshots).
- Conducted and analysed a brute-force attack simulation, documenting the investigation process and findings.

## What I Can Do Now
- Successfully deployed a Microsoft Sentinel SOC and integrated multiple data sources.
- Built interactive dashboards and used KQL for log analysis.
- Integrated Defender for Endpoint and XDR to enhance detection capabilities.
- Customised SOC dashboards to improve visibility and monitoring.
- Practiced documenting and reporting incidents with clear investigation steps.
